Status update: Team has been meeting weekly and helping each other with coding and general questions. We have created a list of all census tracts in our study area, to extract only the data corresponding to our areas of interest.  

Data update: 
- The US Census, County Business Parterns provides data on all the occupation/industry types per county. We will use this data set to approximate how many outdoor workers there are and how they make be disportionately affected by the air quality in our study area. (https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets/cbp-nonemp-zbp/cbp-api.html)
- The National Land Cover Database provides several years of data on land cover in the region, including agricultural land. https://www.mrlc.gov/viewer/
- Airnow: provides historic and current air quality readings at various reading stations, including several near the Salton Sea: https://www.airnow.gov/

Minor Concerns: Finding data sets that include all our years of interest for each of our variables. For example, CalEnvironScreen has air quality & public health data but it is not clear whether the data is available for previous years.
