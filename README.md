# Project Proposal

Terminal lakes have been particularly susceptible to climate change and drought in recent years, with many on the verge of drying up. As these lakes dry, there can be many environmental and health impacts on the nearby populations. The Salton sea provides an example of how these terminal lakes are impacted by both climate change and industry, and how the consequences these changes can have on local communities. 

### Broad Research Question:
What are the impacts of drought and climate cange on the Salton Sea? How have these environmental changes impacted the nearby populations?

### Spatial Components:
Our spatial scope includes the immediate area of the Salton Sea, which is situated between including Riverside and Imperial counties. Depending on data availability we hope to explore changes over time from the 1960s to the present day.

#### Spatial/Focused Research Questions:
- Who lives in the area and who is impacted by the air quality concerns?
- How wide ranging are problems with air quality?
- How are land values in the area distributed? 
  - How have they changed over time?
- How has the population changed over time? 
  - Are people leaving the area?

### Datasets:
The datasets we intend to use include:

  Census/ACS population variables (present day and over time)

  Quarterly Water Quality Surveys - Salton Sea - Department of Fish and Wildlife

  EPA Air Quality Data (present day and over time)

  Public Health Data
    - California Public Health https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/dataset-catalog

### Preliminary Methodology / Flow Chart

### Concluding
The Salton Sea is a great case study to analyze due to multiple factors that created the severity of the situation, continue to feed environmental degradation, and opportunites to manage and restore ecological and public health.
